    <p>I'm a <a href=http://www.chattanoogafun.com>Chattanooga</a> native learning code. I'm a full-time coffee drinker and I enjoy traveling (see photo).</p>
    <p>I'm not really a pet person, but a dog will do.</p>
    <p>With code, I want to help people tell their own stories and to make people aware of the needs of the people around us. Of course, I'll offer my services to a local buisness and probably fill a desk space somewhere, but it's something I want to accomplish.</p>
