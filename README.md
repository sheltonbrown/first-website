    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a <a href=http://www.chattanoogafun.com>Chattanooga</a> native learning code. I'm a full-time coffee drinker and I enjoy traveling (see photo).</p>
    <p>With code, I want to help people tell their own stories (orginial, I know). Of course, I'll offer my services to a local buisness and probably fill a desk space somewhere, but it's something I want to accomplish.</p>
    <p>This is my <strong><em>first</em></strong> website. It's a bit naked right now, but over time I'll continue to add some HTML and CSS as I learn them both. Oh, I can't forget about JavaScript. But one step at a time. As they say, slow and steady wins the race.</p>
